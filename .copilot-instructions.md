# Instructions for AI Assistants

## Version Management - CRITICAL

**DO NOT manually bump versions in these files:**
- `porpoise-ui/package.json`
- `Porpoise.Api/Porpoise.Api.csproj`
- `VERSION.md`

**Why:** CI/CD automatically bumps versions when merging to main. Manual version changes create merge conflicts.

## Git Workflow - SIMPLIFIED

**User's Daily Workflow (AI handles all commits to develop):**

When user says "commit and push to develop":
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push origin develop
```

- ✅ No terminal prompts required
- ✅ No user input needed
- ✅ No version file editing
- ✅ Just commit and push

**Production Releases (User uses GitHub UI):**

When ready to deploy to production:
1. User goes to GitHub.com → Pull Requests
2. Creates PR: `base: main` ← `compare: develop`
3. Merges through GitHub UI
4. CI/CD automatically:
   - Bumps version numbers in package.json and .csproj
   - Creates version tag
   - Builds and deploys

**Never:**
- ❌ Don't merge develop → main via command line
- ❌ Don't manually edit version numbers
- ❌ Don't commit directly to main

**If VS Code shows tag conflicts:**
- User should click "Replace Local Tag(s)" to sync with remote
- This is normal - CI/CD creates tags automatically
git checkout --theirs VERSION.md porpoise-ui/package.json Porpoise.Api/Porpoise.Api.csproj
git add VERSION.md porpoise-ui/package.json Porpoise.Api/Porpoise.Api.csproj
git commit --no-edit  # Hook skips version check for merge commits

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Don't manually change version numbers
- ❌ Don't merge develop → main via command line (use GitHub UI instead)
- ❌ Don't commit directly to main branch
- ✅ Always work on develop branch
- ✅ Let CI/CD handle all versioning
- ✅ Use GitHub UI for production releases (develop → main)
- ✅ If VS Code prompts about tag conflicts, user clicks "Replace Local Tag(s)"

## Development Server Management

- **DO NOT restart dev servers** - The user already has servers running (npm run dev, dotnet watch)
- Vite hot-reloads automatically for file changes
- Only suggest restarting if there's a genuine build error or dependency change

## User Preferences

- **Git expertise:** User prefers not to learn complex git commands - keep it simple
- **Bedtime:** 11:00 PM - Remind user to wrap up work around this time
- **Work style:** Prefers iterative development with testing before commits
