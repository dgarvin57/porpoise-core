# Completed Migrations Archive

This folder contains documentation for major migrations and refactoring work that has been **completed and deployed**.

These documents serve as historical reference for:
- Understanding past architectural decisions
- Troubleshooting legacy issues
- Onboarding new developers

## Documents

- **QUESTION_BLOCKS_MIGRATION.md** - Normalization of question blocks from Questions table into separate QuestionBlocks table (completed December 2024)

## Note

The work described in these documents is **finished**. The current codebase already reflects these changes. These are kept for reference only, not for implementation.
